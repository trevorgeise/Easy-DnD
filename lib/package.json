  "description": "Easy-DnD is a drag and drop implementation for Vue.js 2 that uses only standard mouse events instead of the HTML5 drag and drop API, which is [impossible to work with](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html). Think of it as a way to transfer data from some components to others using the mouse or support for a mouse assisted copy/cut - paste. It also allows for lists to be reordred by drag and drop.",
